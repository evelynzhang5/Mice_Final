            So far, our group pulled the mice estrus dataset and created a visualization that races mouse towards against time. <br>
            We experimented several approaches to turn the data into an interactive game (such as mice drag race) where the user has different controls. <br>
            We created toolkit and buttons that control and follow the moving dots as time progresses. <br>
            We created functions that render the dots as times goes on and set them apart on the same vertical line.

            The challenges of this projects are around design, the first one is how to design a game-like interactive visualization that conveys the idea of the study but is also fun. <br>
            The second challenge is that we need to further aggregate our data, in the last project we only used two group-by, depends on our game design, we need to modify the data in different ways and test the result. <br>
            The second challenge is the overall styling, how do we represent each mouse, and how do we style the webpage so that it does not look like a mess when the mice are racing. <br>
            Lastly, the javascript implementation can be expoenentially more complex, we are constantly pulling off data from stored arrays then render it, if we have a more complex game, such as maze traversing, then the code will have another hundereds of lines, so we need to optimize run-time. <br>
